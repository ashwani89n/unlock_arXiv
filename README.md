# Unlock arXiv | LLMs, Mistral – 7B, Hugging Face, Ludwig API, Python 

Submitted by: Ashwani Balakrishnan Neminimadathil

arXiv.org, a repository hosting over two million scholarly articles across various disciplines, is a vital resource for scientific research. However, its extensive and highly technical content presents significant challenges for accessibility, particularly for users without advanced domain expertise. This project addresses these limitations by developing an LLM-powered chatbot utilizing Mistral-7B, a state-of-the-art large language model, to streamline access to and comprehension of arXiv’s content. The chatbot leverages advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to interpret user queries and generate concise, contextually accurate responses, bridging the gap between complex scientific literature and its broader audience.The methodology includes extensive data pre-processing to create a structured dataset focusing on machine learning topics from arXiv abstracts, with a question-answer format optimized for fine-tuning the Mistral-7B base model. Fine-tuning utilizes techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA) and 8-bit quantization to optimize memory usage and computational efficiency. The chatbot's performance is evaluated using a comprehensive suite of metrics, including BERT Score, BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE, ensuring the quality, relevance, and accuracy of generated responses. Human evaluations further validate contextual understanding and user satisfaction. This work offers a scalable solution to improving the accessibility of complex scientific knowledge, making arXiv’s vast corpus more understandable for a wider audience. By efficiently extracting and presenting relevant insights, the chatbot enhances content discovery and interaction with scholarly databases. This project not only advances conversational capabilities for domain-specific content but also contributes to making scientific knowledge more accessible and navigable in the growing digital landscape.
